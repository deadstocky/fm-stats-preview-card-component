## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Adding overlays to images is trickier than I remembered. Always thought a simple background-blend-mode would do the trick but styling div's with background-image is a lot more difficult and comes with far too many drawbacks. You end up dealing with a lot workarounds for positioning than creating the overlay. Tip: always use a div positioned over an img in order to achieve an overlay effect.
- Learned more about screen readers and aria-labels. Found it useful to actually use VoiceOver and navigate the component to see what was missing. Interesting to see that VoiceOver reads span text individually rather than the whole div.
